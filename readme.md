### Tailwind CSS (v3) working with Stencil JS.

A simple project with Tailwind CSS v3 (JIT engine) included.

#### Remaining issues:

- Tailwind CSS classes don't regenerate when saving a change in the HTML or one of the components. Try to change or add a new tailwind css class while running a dev server `npm start`. The Tailwind CSS classes have not Hello, World!. But when you restart the server with `npm start` after you've made a change, the Tailwind CSS classes _are_ refreshed.
